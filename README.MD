## Python Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of commonly used algorithms implemented in Python.

### Algorithms Included:

- Limit: Find the minimum value of a given list of numbers.
- Top One: Find the largest value in a given list of numbers.
- Caesar Cipher: Encrypt a message using the Caesar cipher.
- Search Insert: Find the position where an element should be inserted in a sorted list.
- Is Isomorphic: Check if two strings are isomorphic.
- A1Z26 Cipher: Encrypt a message using the A1Z26 cipher.
- Bead Sort: Sort a list of numbers using the bead sort algorithm.
- Zig Zag Iterator: Create an iterator that traverses a matrix in a zig-zag pattern.
- Move Zeros: Move all zeros to the end of a given list.
- Remove Min: Remove the minimum value from a given list.
- OneTimePad Cipher: Encrypt a message using the OneTimePad cipher.
- Two Sum: Find two numbers in a given list that sum to a given target value.
- Rotate: Rotate a list by a given number of positions.
- Search Range: Find the first and last occurrences of an element in a sorted list.
- Linear Search: Perform a linear search for a given element in a list.
- Binary Search: Perform a binary search for a given element in a sorted list.
- First Occurrence: Find the first occurrence of an element in a given list.
- Last Occurrence: Find the last occurrence of an element in a given list.

### Usage

To use any of the algorithms, simply import the corresponding module and call the appropriate function. For example:

```python
from algorithms.limit import limit

result = limit([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(result)
```
